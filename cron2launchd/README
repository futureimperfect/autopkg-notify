cron2launchd.py
.9 beta 1

This script will take a crontab line as input and generate the basic plist for used with launchd
Its primary feature is to expand cron's concise notation into an array start interval dictionaries used by launchd

Usage:

cron2launchd.py -c '*/40 9-16/2 2 5,6 * say "test"' -l com.example.launchd.label > myfile.plist


questions for the early birds:
what other launchd keys should this handle by default?

Note that the crontab.py file needs to be in the same folder as this script, or put somewhere in your python path (ie /Library/Python/2.5/site-packages)
